# TI Calculator Programs

### A few calculator programs for Texus Instruments Calculators


All programs are inside the 'programs' folder.
All programs should have a .8xp file (the one that you put into the calculator) and a .txt file (for easy reading).
Note: some of the characters used in the .8xp files don't translate to .txt.

If you are wondering why this is a node project, I plan on converting all of them into a javascript all in one function too.

## Installation

#### Required Programs:

- TI Connect/TI Connect CE
	- use [TI Connect](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/B59F6C83468C4574ABFEE93D2BC3F807/swticonnectsoftware) if your calculator is not of the CE variety.
	- use [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware) if your calculator is of the CE variey.


####

- Plug calculator in
- Launch TI Connect
- Go to Calculator Explorer (middle icon on the left)
- Drag files in
- Send to Location: Archive

## Usage

- Click ``prgm`` key
- select desired program
- click enter
- follow instructions on screen (detailed instructions for each program below)

### Area Calculation

- Select the shape that you need the area of
	- Note: only accepts:
		- Rectangles, Squares, Parallelograms
		- All Triangles
		- Trapezoids
		- Rhombuses and Kites
		- All Regular Polygons
		- Circles

	- Note 2: Circle can also calculate circumference
- If select triangle or circle, select type.
- Input required information

### Distance

- No clue what this does, made it a while ago and just found it.

### Factoring Quadratics

- Idk how to explain this, so I'll just use an example.  Our Quadratic will be: x^2 + 2x - 15
- Add To: 2
	-The number in the middle
- Multiply To: -15
	- The number at the end.  Make sure to put negative and not subtract while inputting negative numbers
- The answer is -3 and 5, so the factor would be (x+5)(x-3)

### Pythagorean Calculator

- Any of the inputs can be what you are trying to solve for, just put X
- the Hypotenuse is the longest leg
- put in your numbers and get out your X
- not sure what else to put here, it's pretty self-explanatory

### Quadratic Formula

- Does the whole quadratic formula thing
	- [this](https://youtu.be/VOXYMRcWbF8)
- Input your A
- Input your B
- Input your C
- get your 2 (and no more than 2) answers

### Simplify Radicals

- AKA, the most useful program I have ever created
	- (I must note that it was with the help of the internet)
- Input your index
	- For a square root, that's 2
	- For a cube root, that's 3
- Input the number inside of the radical
- Answer is in format: Number outside radicalâˆšindex(number still inside radical)
	- It's a pretty awkward display method... I'm working on it.

### Triangle

- Does not print a triangle in ASCII
	- nor does it print any other image
- you put in the legs and hypotenuse of your triangle
- it tells you if your triangle is in compliance with Euclidean geometry
	- true if it is
	- false if it is not

### Volume Calculation

- Still a work in progress
	- If you want to finish it up, be my guest, I don't really care enough to.
- Basically just the Area Calculation program but for volume and it doesn't work.
